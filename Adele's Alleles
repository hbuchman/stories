Adele's dress crinkled as she came into the room where Hayley was getting ready.

"Hi cousin Hayley", she said brightly.

"Hey Adele!"

---

"Hey Hayley? My mom says you're my cousin, but what does that mean?"

Hayley paused for a minute than said, "It means we're family, but also that we share a lot of the same genes."

Adele thought about this answer before asking, "What's a gene?".

---

As Hayley leaned toward the mirror to pin her hair into place she said, "Genes are long stretches of DNA that make you who you are."

Adele was not satisfied. "What do you mean? How does that work?"

---

Hayley told her, "DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA lives in special houses inside all your cells.
Those houses are called nuclei. When the DNA wants to do something it sends mRNA (messanger ribonucleic acid) outside to tell the cell to make a protein."

"Oh!" said Adele. "Nuts and beans have lots of proteins! They make you grow big and strong. Is that what you mean?"

---

At that moment Liam came barreling into the room, "No! Adele that's wrong. There are all kinds of proteins and they do all kinds of things in cells."

Adele looked downtrodden and quietly said, "Oh okay. I'm sorry."

Hayley looked at Liam with a little exasperation before she said, "It's okay to be wrong but you're not really wrong. Those proteins are just some of the ones Liam is talking about."

---

Liam looked pleased but then said, "Sorry Adele. I didn't mean to make you feel bad." 

A minute later he added, "In school my teacher said I had brown eyes because of my genes."

Hayley told him, "That's right! Your genes control all kinds of things about you."

---

Liam and Adele immediately asked, "Like what? Like what?"

Hayley paused then said, "They tell you if you need glasses."

---

Adele nodded before asking "What else?."

Hayley said, "Lots of times they tell if you're going to get sick. They partially tell how tall you're going to be."

Adele nodded before asking "What else?."

---

Hayley told her, "Lots more things. Sometimes we aren't sure if things are genetic or environmental. Like you two are so smart and curious. Is that your genes or your great parents?"

Adele said "I think it's Mommy." 

To which Hayley responded, "I think so too."

As she finished her sentence Adele's mom walked into the room and asked, "Ready to go?"

"Time for the nutcracker!", Adele said as she twirled around in her skirt.
