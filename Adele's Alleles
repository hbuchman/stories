Adele: Hi cousin Hayley. My mom says you're my cousin, but what does that mean?

Hayley: It means we're family, but also that we share a lot of the same genes.

Adele: What's a gene?

Hayley: Genes are long stretches of DNA that make you who you are

Adele: What do you mean? How does that work?

Hayley: DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA lives in special houses inside all your cells.
Those houses are called nuclei. When the DNA wants to do something it sends mRNA (messanger ribonucleic acid) outside to tell the cell to make a protein.

Adele: Nuts and beans have lots of proteins! They make you grow big and strong. Is that what you mean?

Liam: NO! Adele that's wrong. There are all kinds of proteins and they do all kinds of things.

Adele: Oh okay. I'm sorry

Hayley: It's okay to be wrong and you're not really wrong. There are all kinds of proteins and they do all kinds of things.

Liam: Sorry Adele. I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
In school my teacher said I had brown eyes because of my genes

Hayley: That's right! Your genes control all kinds of things about you

Liam: Like what?

Adele: Yeah! Like what?

Hayley: They tell you if you need glasses

Adele: What else?

Hayley: Lots of times they tell if you're going to get sick. They partially tell how tall you're going to be.

Adele: What else?

Hayley: Lots more things. Sometimes we aren't sure if things are genetic or environmental. Like you two are so smart and curious. Is that your genes or your great parents?

Adele: I think it's Mommy. 

Hayley: I think so too.
